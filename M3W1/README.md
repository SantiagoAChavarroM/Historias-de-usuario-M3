This project corresponds to **User Story Week 1** of Module 3 at **Riwi**.

The main goal of this project is to build a simple interactive program in JavaScript that requests user information, validates input data, and displays dynamic messages based on conditions.

---

## 🧩 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Basic structure to run the script in the browser
- **JavaScript ES6+** – Core application logic

---

## 📁 Project Structure

```bash
M3W1/
│
├── index.html
└── sistema_interactivo.js
⚙️ Installation and Usage
Open the index.html file in your browser.

The program will automatically prompt the user for:

Name

Age

Based on the input, a dynamic message will be displayed.

🧠 Learnings
During this project, the following concepts were reinforced:

Variable declaration using let and const

JavaScript data types

Use of prompt(), alert(), console.log() and console.error()

Input validation using Number() and Number.isNaN()

Conditional statements (if, else if, else)

Good variable naming practices using camelCase

Code organization with comments
